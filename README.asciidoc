test pio
========

The test_pio is a firmware for the https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/[RaspberryPi Pico board] that allows to experiment with the PIOs.

:toc:

== features

 - USB CDCD(serial port) command line interface

== building and starting

The firmware can be build using make. The generated Files will be placed in the bin folder. For details try

+make help+

for this to work you (obviously) need to have make installed.
Depending on the target you are building for you might need to have additionaltools installed:

- To build for ARM Cortex-M Targets you need https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded[GCC ARM Embedded]
- to flash and program you need https://openocd.org/[OpenOCD]
- to create an *.uf2 file you need https://github.com/JustAnother1/elf2uf2/releases[elf2uf2]

== pinout

=== pico
The pico has 40 pins (1..40) Numbered counter clock wise starting at the USB connector.

== Acknowledgments

This project would not be possible without many other open source projects.
This project relies on gcc for ARM Cortex-M, gdb, lcov, doxygen, make and many more.
For all this help we want to thank the Linux and open source community.
